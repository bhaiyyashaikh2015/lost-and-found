<h4 class="text-justify">Everyone misplaces things from time to time,
    but that doesn’t make it any less frustrating when it happens to you.
    Berating yourself for losing track of an item and wasting time with haphazard searches are normal responses,
    but they won’t help you get any closer to recovering the lost item.
    Stay calm, review your actions, and do systematic,
    thorough searches in the places you think the item might be to find it as soon as possible.</h4>
